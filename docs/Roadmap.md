# Roadmap

## Versions
- **Let there be light** ([[docs/versions/v0.1|v0.1]]) - Light, air, and time.
- **Let there be a vault between the waters** v0.2 - Water, sky, and weather.
- **Let dry ground appear** v0.3 - Soil, rocks, and decomposers.
- **Let the earth put forth vegetation** v0.4 - Plants and pollinators.
- **Let there be swarms of living creatures** v0.5 - Ants.

## Out of scope
- **Soil looseness or sand**
  It brings no features and is used for aesthetic purposes. The concept of dirt looseness is also ignored because it adds too much complexity to the relationship between dirt and plant.
- **Respiration, oxygen, and carbon**
  These ideas will be ignored for the time being. Creatures will not breathe and plants will not photosynthesize. Even though respiration is extremely interesting and important for these organisms I find it not essential for this simulation's purposes.
- **Gravity in any block other than water**
  Dirt crumbling in, rocks falling when unsupported, and other gravity phenomena will be ignored until further versions.
- **Water life**
  The water's only role in life is hydration. There will be no nutrients, decomposer organisms, plants, or even further than that, fish. Water blocks are meant to be a risk for organisms like in the flooding or drowning of ants, or the overwatering of plants.
- **Wind**
  The air inside the universe will be perfectly still with no currents of any kind.
