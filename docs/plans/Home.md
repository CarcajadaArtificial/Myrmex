### Notes
#### On properties
- I think of three types of properties: genetic, intrinsic, and consequential.

### To be designed
#### Things
- [ ] Air
	- [x] Light level

	- [ ] Humidity
	- [x] Fertility
	- [ ] Rocks
- [ ] Water
	- [ ] Water physics
	- [ ] Temperature

#### Concepts
- [ ] Time
	- [ ] Tick speed
	- [ ] Order of events
	- [ ] Ticks per day
	- [ ] Calendar
- [ ] Weather
	- [ ] Temperature
	- [ ] Precipitation

#### Creatures

### Out of scope
- Soil looseness or sand - It brings no features and is used for aesthetic purposes. The concept of dirt looseness is also ignored because it adds too much complexity to the relationship between dirt and plant.
- Respiration, oxygen, and carbon - These ideas will be ignored for the time being. Creatures will not breathe and plants will not photosynthesize. Even though respiration is extremely interesting and important for these organisms I find it not essential for this simulation's purposes.
