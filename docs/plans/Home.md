### Notes
#### On properties
- I think of three types of properties: genetic, intrinsic, and consequential.

#### On artificiality
* Inside the universe of this experiment, there is a very clear distinction between natural and artificial events. For example, a natural brain would be an evolved one, and a preprogrammed one will be artificial (or "robotic").
* Let's say I create a map with a bucket-shaped rock and purred water to it; then this would be an artificial phenomenon. If instead, naturally evolved ants pick up rocks and assemble a bucket and let water flow onto it; it would be a natural phenomenon.

#### On brains
* The abstract brain design must have a mechanism that allows it to grow when needed. This way I could create a process for gradually training a brain to do new things without compromising previous knowledge.
* Let's say an ant evolves its brain until it learns to receive food from a robotic ant that is always giving food artificially upon receiving a particular sign. Afterward, I would wish for the ant's brain to feed another ant that is asking for food.

#### On Randomness
- When something cannot be arbitrarily defined, dice could be thrown to create less-biased results. This has to be a careful decision because it would rise the program's complexity.

- Rocks
#### v0.4 - Let the earth put forth vegetation
- Plants
#### v0.5 - Let there be swarms of living creatures
- Pollinators
- Decomposers
#### v0.6 - Let us make antkind in our image
- Ants
#### v0.7 - And he rested on the seventh day

### Out of scope for v1.0.0
- **Soil looseness or sand** - It brings no features and is used for aesthetic purposes. The concept of dirt looseness is also ignored because it adds too much complexity to the relationship between dirt and plant.
- **Respiration, oxygen, and carbon** - These ideas will be ignored for the time being. Creatures will not breathe and plants will not photosynthesize. Even though respiration is extremely interesting and important for these organisms I find it not essential for this simulation's purposes.
- **Gravity in any block other than water** - Dirt crumbling in, rocks falling when unsupported, and other gravity phenomena will be ignored until further versions.
- **Water life** - The water's only role in life is hydration. There will be no nutrients, decomposer organisms, plants, or even further than that, fish. Water blocks are meant to be a risk for organisms like in the flooding or drowning of ants, or the overwatering of plants.
- **Light directionality** - The universe I'm creating is a small flat box with a light source that points perpendicularly down. Cloudy days won't affect the direction of light eighter, they just reduce the maximum light level of the day.
- **Wind** - The air inside the universe will be perfectly still with no currents of any kind.
