Soil is what's going to make up most of the environment. It can be able to be moved around by creatures and usually contains the nutrients that plants need to grow.

## Properties

### Humidity
#Humidity 

This property has similar difficulties to the air block property. I'm uncertain as to how large of a value to use for humidity and the tradeoff is similar. The main difference with air humidity is that soil can hold water if it is completely humid. 

If a drop of water lands in a block of soil, it will begin to absorb it. But if another drop lands on it while it's still absorbing the previous one, the drop will create a small water block on top of the soil one. After finishing absorbing it, if the drop of water remains on top it will be absorbed. And that pattern continues until the soil block has its humidity topped. The plan is to have a hole in the soil and slowly fill it with water. The highest layer of soil blocks will eventually be fully humid so they can hold the body of water blocks that would fill the hole. Soil blocks will have a humidity-spreading rate liked to their proximity to the closest body of water.

Humid soil blocks should also dry out their humidity gradually. This is a tricky characteristic as well. Firstly, soil blocks with direct contact with sunlight must dry faster than underground humidity. If a soil block became dries while being close to a water block, then it must give away some of the water to it. Additionally, soil blocks could dry out at a rate linked to the light level of the air block above it.

### Fertility
#Fertility

In order to keep it simple the fertility will be limited to the common NPK trio. Every nutrient will have a different purpose in the development of a plant. It is the plant's responsibility to evolve to require more or fewer amounts of certain nutrients.
