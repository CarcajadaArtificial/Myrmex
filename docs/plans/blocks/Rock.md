A rock is the simplest block, it's unbreakable and unaffected by gravity. Its main purpose is to hinder organisms and create more diverse arrangements. When encountering rocks, the ants are unable to lift them and must build around them. The only property of rocks is to which neighboring rock blocks it is connected. The uncertain part about rocks is that I don't know how to add gravity to them. 

Should there be rocks so small that can be lifted by one ant? Should multiple ants be able to lift a single rock like in Pikmin? 

## Properties

### Lateral Connection
#LateralConnection

This property allows larger rocks to be formed. By being laterally connected to other rock blocks, all come together to create a single block.
