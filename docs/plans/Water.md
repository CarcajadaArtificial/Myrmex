Water blocks conform to the minimum requirement to be a body of water. Any other representation of water like humidity or hydration will be handled separately.

## Properties

### Water Level
#WaterLevel

A water block is represented by a 4-bit number that represents how much of that block's volume is water. If a water block is in contact with one or more air blocks, it must share a unit of water with them, and the same happens with water blocks with a lower water level.

### Gravity
#Gravity

If a water block is spawned mid-air through rain, falling down a cliff like a waterfall, or if the soil under it disappeared, the water block must fall down. I am unsure what would happen to reasonably full water blocks, should they spread mid-air while falling?
