## Concepts

### Tick Speed
* A tick refers to the main unit of time relative to the simulated universe. Inside there, time will pass in ticks, instead of seconds.
* A tick in this universe is not convertible to a "real-world" time unit (e.g. seconds). This is because it can have different "real-life" durations depending on the number of things to simulate. 
* If the computer takes care of any reasonable calculation inside a tick, in less time than a second, then the simulated universe could run at "real-world" time speed. The simulated universe will run at one tick per second. Time could be synched up between them.
* If the world is too large and there are too many variables, this may not be possible and something must be limited or optimized.

### Calendar
- A day inside the simulated universe will be equal to 86,400 ticks.
- It would use a Gregorian Calendar.

### Order of events
1. The light will spread from top to bottom.
2. The temperature will spread from top to bottom.
3. The humidity will evaporate from top to bottom.
4. The humidity will spread in the soil starting from the closest's to a water block, to the farthest inside the humidity spread range.
5. The water will move.
6. The nutrients will move or appear.
7. The plants will move.
8. The ants will move.
