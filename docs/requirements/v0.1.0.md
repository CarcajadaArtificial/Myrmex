# Let there be light

## Features
- Create a map with:
	- A grid of sky blocks.
	- A calendar with the weather for each hour.
- Display the map with:
	- UI that shows the time and the weather.
	- UI that controls the speed of time, pauses and skips any number of time blocks.

### World Editor
- The user should be able to create a map file. The map requires horizontal dimensions to be set to it. This will create the size of the grid of sky blocks. Additionally, the weather must also be added in this step using an input of an IRL location and a year.
- The user should be able to save the settings as a file to be used as the seed of the world.
- The created world will add a layer of air blocks that will be used to observe the changes in the weather.
- Calendar preview where the user can see what the weather will be on any date.
#oos
- The block placement interface. There will be no block visualization yet.
- The world height.

### World Viewer
- The user should be able to add a map file and select a starting date for starting the world play.
- The user should be able to control the flow of time inside the world:
	- Pause/Play.
	- Skip x-number of ticks/minutes/hours/days.
	- Multiply the speed of a tick compared to an IRL second.
- The user should be able to see the current weather and time data.
	- The light level, temperature, and humidity in the sky block grid.
	- The current date and time.
	- The number of days that have passed since the beginning.
- Indicator of how much time it takes for a full tick to be calculated. This should be useful for seeing how much space there is available for more calculations.
- The single level of air blocks will be displayed width
	- A filter for the temperature values.
	- A filter for the humidity values.
	- A filter for the light values.

## Design

### Home Page
- Access to the world editor.
- Access to the world viewer.

### Weather Values component
- Bit value (0-n)
- Human value (Â°C for temperature, words like "sunny" for humidity, and percentage for light level)
- A visual gauge.

### World Editor
* Input the world's dimensions.
* Input an IRL city and year.
* Preview the calendar and weather. For every value (humidity, light, temperature)
	- #maybe Statistics for the values. How average the values are? How much does it change in a day or month? Visually graph the changes of every value along the year.

### World Viewer
- Weather and time values
	- Weather values component
	- Current time and date.
	- The number of days that have passed.
- Time controls
	- Play/Pause buttons
	- Skip x-number of ticks/minutes/hours/days. For buttons, one for every time block and a number input for the number of skips.
	- Input multiplier for the tick speed.
- Filter interface for a particular block.
	- An input select with the block types.
	- When the block type is selected, there is a radio fieldset with the property to filter.
- Tick usage indicator.
	- Number in ms of how much time it took to do all calculations.

## Tests

### No time drift
- Check if the duration of 60 ticks is exactly one minute.
