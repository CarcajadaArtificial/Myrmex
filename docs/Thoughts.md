## On properties
- I think of three types of properties: genetic, intrinsic, and consequential.

## On artificiality
* Inside the universe of this experiment, there is a very clear distinction between natural and artificial events. For example, a natural brain would be an evolved one, and a preprogrammed one will be artificial (or "robotic").
* Let's say I create a map with a bucket-shaped rock and purred water to it; then this would be an artificial phenomenon. If instead, naturally evolved ants pick up rocks and assemble a bucket and let water flow onto it; it would be a natural phenomenon.

## On brains
* The abstract brain design must have a mechanism that allows it to grow when needed. This way I could create a process for gradually training a brain to do new things without compromising previous knowledge.
* Let's say an ant evolves its brain until it learns to receive food from a robotic ant that is always giving food artificially upon receiving a particular sign. Afterward, I would wish for the ant's brain to feed another ant that is asking for food.

## On Randomness
- When something cannot be arbitrarily defined, dice could be thrown to create less-biased results. This has to be a careful decision because it would rise the program's complexity.
